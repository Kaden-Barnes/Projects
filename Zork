You see a cot next to you on your right and a bucket to your left. In front of you a door with just a small slit of light under the door in an otherwise dark room. What do you do?",
        	"Yeah, I don't know man come, on I bet we could just walk in and take him out. I don't think you understand. The wizard told us to make sure no one in, no one out. The prisoner is super dangerous. oh come on, just a little torture? We just greased the lock. Its silent no one would even know.Shut up. You know the plan.",
			"You run up the stairs 2 at a time. And charge up to the closed door and burst through it. The door slams against the inner wall allowing you to see the dark wizard of the tower standing in the middle of a small circular room. The room is filled wall to ceiling in bookshelves. Most look abandoned to the mercy of dust and cobwebs. But as you focus on the man standing with his back to you in the middle of the room the shelves fade, and the faint whisper of a chuckle comes to your ears. The room grows foggy and white. Ah so the sleeping giant finally comes to my door. Well I guess we must finish this then? *You nod* Fine, I'm too old for this. So here is the truth. I am currently channeling protections and wards that allow me to speak freely without you destroying me. However, If I am to beat you I must cast arcane missile at you. We both know that I won't survive as I don't have the energy to cast it and the protections. So... we are at a standstill. A silence ensues. The man turns slowly to face you with just a small sad smile. I guess I have one chance to walk out of this alive."];
